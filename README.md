# Multi-Layer-Perceptron- Shallow Neural network
In this challenge, we invite Kagglers to help us identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem. 

This is another kaggle competition and the dataset was provided by Santander bank. It has the same structure as a real dataset and is used for the training, validation and test sets.The goal is to identify trends and predict if a customer will make a specific transaction in the future.Using a shallow neural network model, I was able to come up with a 0.65 training score and 0.64 validation score.
